# TimerEventDefinition

TimerEventDefinition behaviour.

## TimerEventDefinition events

The timer event definition publish a number of events.

### `activity.timer`

Fired when the timer is started.

Object with properties. A subset:

- `content:` object with activity and timer information
  - [`timeDuration`](#timeduration): the resolved time duration if any
  - [`timeDate`](#timedate): the resolved expire date if any
  - [`timeCycle`](#timecycle): the resolved time cycle if any
  - `startedAt`: timer started at date
  - `expireAt`: timer expires at date
  - `repeat`: repeated timer number of repetitions, -1 means unbounded number of repetitions. NB! Only viable when used in non-interrupting BoundaryEvent

### `activity.timeout`

Fired when the timer has timed out or was cancelled.

Object with `activity.timer` properties and some:

- `content:` object with activity and timer information
  - `stoppedAt`: stopped at date
  - `runningTime`: running for milliseconds

## `timeDuration`

Default support for ISO8601 duration. Will set a timer (`setTimeout`) for the duration and then complete when timed out. Invalid ISI8601 duration will throw and stop the execution.

Uses [`@0dep/piso`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@0dep/piso) to parse duration and repetitions. Consequently [ISO8601 intervals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) are supported.

## `timeDate`

Behaves the same as `timeDuration`. Due date will timeout immediately. An invalid date, like `2023-02-29`, will throw and stop the execution.

Uses [`@0dep/piso`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@0dep/piso) to parse date according to [ISO8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601).

## `timeCycle`

Time cycles are parsed with [`@0dep/piso`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@0dep/piso) that also handles ISO8601 intervals.

If another format is used, e.g. cron, you need to handle that by [extending the behavior](#set-your-own-timeout). There are several modules to handle time cycles and this project tries to keep the number of dependencies to a minimum.

## Combined `timeDuration` and `timeDate`

The shortest timeout will be picked to start the timer.

## Set your own timeout

If the parent event start message has an `expireAt` date or `timeout` positive integer property a timer will be started.

See how to format these messages [here](/docs/Extension.md).

Another alternative is to override the [parse function](#timereventdefinitionparsetimertype-value).

## Api

Timer event definition api.

### `TimerEventDefinition.parse(timerType, value)`

Parse timer value into expire date.

Arguments:

- `timerType`: timer type string, one of `timeDuration`, `timeCycle`, or `timeDate`
- `value`: resolved expression timer string

Returns object:

- `expireAt`: expires at date
- `delay`: delay in milliseconds
- `repeat`: repeat number of times
