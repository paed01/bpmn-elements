# Bpmn IO

The implementation of data storage in this project is rather basic. It relies on object assigned to `environment.variables._data`. Use it for reference and preferably override it with your own implementation.

# DataObject

Process data object element

# DataStoreReference

Process data store reference element. Will be returned since some modellers don't add a datastore when designing.

# DataStore

Definition data store

# InputOutputSpecification

Activity input/output element

# Property

Activity property element
